# About
Hi, I’m Kuan-Hsun Tu, an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Tsung-Wei Ke](https://twke18.github.io).

My research focuses on the infrastructure for scalable embodied AI — system backbones, digital twin pipelines, and reinforcement learning exploration strategies — with the goal of enabling robots to truly work in the real world.

I have also trained in systems and networking under [Prof. Hsin-Mu (Michael) Tsai](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hsinmu/site/), and in High-Performance Computing (HPC) through collaboration with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://elsalab.ai/about). These experiences complement my research by grounding it in robust infrastructure and scalable computation.

For a detailed overview, see my [CV](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).
