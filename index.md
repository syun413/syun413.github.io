# About

Hi, I’m **Kuan-Hsun Tu**, an undergraduate at National Taiwan University (CSIE).

My work lies at the intersection of **Robotics**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, where I enjoy combining research ideas with hands-on experience in large-scale systems.

For a detailed overview, see my [CV](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).
