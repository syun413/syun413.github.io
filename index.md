# About
Hi, I’m Kuan-Hsun Tu, an undergraduate researcher at National Taiwan University (CSIE). My work focuses on Embodied AI at the intersection of Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs), and digital twin systems, advised by [Prof. Tsung-Wei Ke](https://twke18.github.io).

I have also received training in systems and networking from [Prof. Hsin-Mu (Michael) Tsai](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hsinmu/site/), and in High-Performance Computing (HPC) through collaboration with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://elsalab.ai/about). These experiences complement my research by grounding it in robust infrastructure and scalable computation.

For a detailed overview, see my [CV](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).
