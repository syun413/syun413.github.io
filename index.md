# About
Hi, I’m Kuan-Hsun Tu, an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Tsung-Wei Ke](https://twke18.github.io).

My research focuses on infrastructure for scalable embodied AI — system backbones, digital twin pipelines, and reinforcement learning strategies — aiming to bring robots into real-world applications.

Beyond research, I served as the department’s System Administrator and Lead TA for Network Administration and System Administration under [Prof. Hsin-Mu (Michael) Tsai](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hsinmu/site/), and I collaborated with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://elsalab.ai/about) on High-Performance Computing, including competing in the Student Cluster Competition (SCC25) at [SC25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org).

For a detailed overview, see my [CV](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).
