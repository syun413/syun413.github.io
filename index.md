# About
Hi, I’m Kuan-Hsun Tu, an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Tsung-Wei Ke](https://twke18.github.io).

My research focuses on the infrastructure for scalable embodied AI — system backbones, digital twin pipelines, and reinforcement learning exploration strategies — with the goal of enabling robots to truly work in the real world.

I have also served as the Lead TA for Network Administration and System Administration and as the department’s System Administrator under [Prof. Hsin-Mu (Michael) Tsai](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hsinmu/site/), where I oversaw system and network infrastructure and coordinated course support. In addition, I collaborated with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://elsalab.ai/about) on High-Performance Computing (HPC), and our team participated in the [Student Cluster Competition (SCC25)](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/students/student-cluster-competition/) at [SC25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org). These experiences complement my research by grounding it in robust infrastructure and scalable computation.

For a detailed overview, see my [CV](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).
