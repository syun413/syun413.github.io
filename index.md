# About

Welcome! I’m **Kuan-Hsun Tu**, an undergraduate student at National Taiwan University (CSIE).

My interests span **Robotics**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, with hands-on experience in both research and large-scale infrastructure.

Check out my [CV](cv) for a detailed overview, or [download the PDF version](assets/files/cv_single_page.pdf).

I also write occasionally on this site — you can [browse my posts here](posts).
